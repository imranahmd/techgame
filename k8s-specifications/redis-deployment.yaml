redis-deployment.yaml (explained)
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment


apiVersion – tells Kubernetes which API to use.

apps/v1 is the stable version for Deployments.

kind – specifies what Kubernetes object this file defines.

Here it’s a Deployment, which manages Pods automatically — ensures desired replica count and restarts crashed Pods.

metadata:
  name: redis
  labels:
    app: redis


metadata.name – gives the Deployment a name (redis).

metadata.labels – key-value tags used for identifying and selecting resources.

The label app: redis will be used later by Services to connect to these Pods.

spec:
  replicas: 1


Defines how many Pods should run at all times.

1 means only one Redis instance (suitable for simple setups).

In production (clustered Redis), you might use StatefulSets, not Deployments.

  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis


The selector matches Pods with the label app: redis.

This ensures the Deployment knows which Pods it manages.

It must exactly match the labels under the Pod template.

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis


Defines the Pod template — how each Pod in the Deployment should look.

metadata.labels – again defines the same label app: redis.

This allows other Kubernetes objects (like Services) to find and connect to these Pods.

    spec:
      containers:
        - name: redis
          image: redis:7.2-alpine


Inside the Pod, we define containers.

name: identifies the container (must be unique within a Pod).

image: the Docker image to use.

redis:7.2-alpine → latest stable Redis version with a lightweight Alpine base image.

          ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
              name: redis


containerPort → exposes port 6379 inside the Pod (Redis default port).

name: helpful for referencing the port in Service or network policies.

          command: ["redis-server", "--appendonly", "yes"]


Overrides the default container startup command.

Starts the Redis server with Append Only File (AOF) persistence:

This ensures Redis writes every operation to disk (in /data).

Without this, data would be lost if the Pod restarts.

          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "100m"
            limits:
              memory: "256Mi"
              cpu: "200m"


Sets resource management rules:

requests = the minimum resources Kubernetes guarantees for the Pod.

limits = the maximum resources it can use.
This ensures Redis doesn’t consume too much memory or CPU and affects other apps.

          volumeMounts:
            - name: redis-data
              mountPath: /data


Mounts a storage volume inside the container.

/data is where Redis stores its database files.

name: redis-data refers to a volume defined below.

      volumes:
        - name: redis-data
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: redis-pvc


Defines the volume that the container will use.

Here we use a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) named redis-pvc.

This ensures data persists even if the Pod restarts.

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: redis-pvc


This defines the actual PersistentVolumeClaim resource.

It requests a chunk of storage from your cluster’s storage class.

spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi


accessModes:

ReadWriteOnce = volume can be mounted as read-write by one node only.

resources.requests.storage:

Requests 1Gi (1 gigabyte) of persistent disk space.

This PVC ensures that Redis data (in /data) remains intact even if:

The Pod restarts,

The node reboots, or

The Deployment is recreated.
